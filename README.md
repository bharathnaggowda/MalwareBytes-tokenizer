All the jar files are under target folder

Assumptions:
1. The request body in the acceptance criteria has duplicate key "cardNumber" 
	'{ " cardNumber": "4007000000027", " expirationDate": "02/20", " cardNumber": "123" }'
	I am replacing the duplicate cardNumber with "cvv". So the request body looks like below
	'{ "cardNumber": "4007000000027", "expirationDate": "02/20", "cvv": "123" }'
2. Creating a secretkey for each request and fetching secretkey from redis based on the transactionId.
3. Kafka Zookeeper is running at localhost with default port : "127.0.0.1:2181"
4. Redis running at localhost with default port : "127.0.0.1:6379"
5. I understand that, sensitive information should not be printed in logs but to make it easy to understand the flow, I am printing all the details in the log.

Steps to run:
1. I am using spring boot libraries to create kafka topics and hence there is no need of service dependency setup. The topics will be created as part of spring startup.
2. Open terminal and run command "java -jar tokenizer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"
3. Open another terminal and send curl command
	curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:8080/api/auth -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "cardNumber": "4007000000027", "expirationDate": "02/20", "cvv": "123" }'
4. The response should look like below
	{"success":"true","transactionId":"zqIgASxvf4oTkQjhfxzi"}
5. The detailed logging can be found at target/app.log file
